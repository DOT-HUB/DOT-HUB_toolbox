DOT-HUB LUMO TOOLBOX
This repository contains a range of matlab functions and scripts designed for interfacing with the Gowerlabs LUMO HD-DOT device and processing
of the resulting data. Some elements of the LUMO_toolbox work independently of the rest of the DOT-HUB toolbox, but probably easiest to clone the whole package.
