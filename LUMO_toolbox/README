DOT-HUB LUMO TOOLBOX
This repository contains a range of matlab functions and scripts designed for interfacing with the Gowerlabs LUMO HD-DOT device and processing
of the resulting data.  

To use this toolbox, simply clone or download the repository and add the contents to your matlab path. There are a number of dependencies, 
including our own Function Library (see in repositories); toml: https://github.com/g-s-k/matlab-toml; homer2: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/homer2; 
and iso2mesh: http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi

This toolbox is open source, but is designed predominantly for internal use, and maintainance/change requests may or may not
be followed up.
