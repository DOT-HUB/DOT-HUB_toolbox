# DOT-HUB Toolbox
This toolbox is a set of scripts and functions (and examples), that supports all the steps required to go from raw fNIRS/DOT/HD-DOT data to 3D and grey-matter-surface diffuse optical tomography images. Currently built around TOAST++. This toolbox was written primarily for internal use at UCL, so change requests/support may or may not be possible.

INSTALLATION:
Clone the DOT-HUB Toolbox repository to your local drive, and add it to your matlab path.  You will also need: 

Toast++ (http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/vis/toast/) downloaded and in your matlab path.
Homer2 (tested with v2.8: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/homer2/) src code (not installation) downloaded and in your matlab path.
